# Queue Data Structure in JavaScript: The Line-Up Chronicles üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüö∂‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Imagine you're at the grand opening of the world's first "Queue Caf√©," where the only thing on the menu is the experience of standing in line. Yes, you heard it right! It's a caf√© where the main attraction is the queue itself. Welcome to the Queue Caf√©, where the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle reigns supreme!

## The Queue Caf√© Experience ‚òï

As you enter the Queue Caf√©, you're greeted by a friendly host who explains the rules: "Here at Queue Caf√©, the first person to join the line is the first to be served. It's all about fairness and order!"

### The Line-Up

1. **Alice** arrives first, eager to experience the novelty of standing in line. She takes her place at the front.
2. **Bob** follows, joining the line behind Alice, wondering if there's a secret menu.
3. **Charlie** enters next, excitedly chatting about the latest queue trends.
4. **Daisy** joins the line, curious about what happens at the end.

As more people join, the line grows longer, and the anticipation builds. The Queue Caf√© is buzzing with excitement!

### The Queue Mechanism

In JavaScript, a queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO principle. Just like at the Queue Caf√©, the first person (or element) to join the queue is the first to leave.

- **Enqueue**: Adding a new person to the end of the line.
- **Dequeue**: Serving the person at the front of the line, allowing them to leave.
- **Peek**: Checking who's next in line without serving them.

### The Grand Finale üéâ

Finally, it's time for Alice to be served. She steps forward, receives her "Queue Experience Certificate," and exits the line with a smile. Bob, Charlie, and Daisy follow in order, each receiving their certificate and leaving the caf√© with a newfound appreciation for the art of queuing.

And so, the Queue Caf√© continues to delight visitors with its simple yet satisfying experience, one person at a time.

Remember, in the world of queues, patience is a virtue, and everyone gets their turn!

Here are five assignments designed to practice the queue data structure in JavaScript

### Assignment 1: Implement a Basic Queue

**Objective:** Create a basic queue class in JavaScript.

**Instructions:**

- Implement a `Queue` class with methods `enqueue`, `dequeue`, `peek`, and `isEmpty`.
- Test the queue by enqueuing and dequeuing some elements.

### Assignment 2: Reverse a Queue

**Objective:** Reverse the elements of a queue.

**Instructions:**

- Create a function `reverseQueue(queue)` that takes a queue as input.
- Use a stack to reverse the order of elements in the queue.
- Return the reversed queue.

### Assignment 3: Check Palindrome Using Queue

**Objective:** Use a queue to check if a string is a palindrome.

**Instructions:**

- Create a function `isPalindrome(input)` that takes a string as input.
- Use a queue to check if the string reads the same forward and backward.
- Return `true` if it is a palindrome, otherwise `false`.

### Assignment 4: Implement a Circular Queue

**Objective:** Implement a circular queue with a fixed size.

**Instructions:**

- Create a `CircularQueue` class with methods `enqueue`, `dequeue`, `peek`, `isEmpty`, and `isFull`.
- Ensure that the queue wraps around when it reaches the end of the array.
- Test the circular queue with various operations.

### Assignment 5: Queue Simulation

**Objective:** Simulate a simple queue system, such as a ticket counter.

**Instructions:**

- Create a function `simulateQueue(customers, serviceTime)` where `customers` is an array of customer names and `serviceTime` is the time taken to serve each customer.
- Use a queue to simulate the serving process, printing each customer's name as they are served.
- Return the total time taken to serve all customers.

These assignments cover various aspects of queue operations and applications, helping to reinforce the understanding of queue data structures in JavaScript.
